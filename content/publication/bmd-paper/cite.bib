abstract = "Background
Bone mineral density (BMD) has been found to improve after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. There are few data on the effect of PTX on BMD in normocalcemic and normohormonal primary hyperparathyroidism.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of 92 primary hyperparathyroidism patients who underwent PTX between 2004 and 2012 with pre- and post-PTX dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed. Within-person changes in BMD pre- and post-PTX were analyzed using log linear mixed models, stratified by biochemical status.
Results
Bone mineral density increased post-PTX in the whole cohort at the lumbar spine (+2.5%), femoral neck (+2.1%), and total hip (+1.9%) and decreased at the one-third radius (–0.9%). On comparison of BMD changes by profile, BMD increased in those with the typical profile at the lumbar spine (3.2%), femoral neck (2.9%), and total hip (2.9%) but declined at the one-third radius (–1.5%). In contrast, BMD improved only at the femoral neck (4.3%) in the normohormonal group and did not change at any site in the normocalcemic group. The typical group had a greater increase in BMD over time at the femoral neck and total hip compared with normocalcemic patients.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that the skeletal benefit of PTX was attenuated in normocalcemic and normohormonal patients, suggesting that skeletal changes after PTX may depend on biochemical profile."
