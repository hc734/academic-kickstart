My name is Cindy Chen, and I am currently a post-graduate research associate at Yale School of Medicine working with [Jennifer Kim](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jennifer_a_kim/) on delayed cerebral ischemia detection using EEG. I graduated Cornell University in May 2019 with a degree in Biometry & Statistics and a minor in music. Previously, I have done research with [Clarence Lee](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/cl2278/) at Cornell University.
